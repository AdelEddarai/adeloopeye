# Flight Tracking Fix - Production Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
Flights were not showing in production (Netlify) but worked in local development. The issue was caused by:

1. **Duplicate implementations**: Two different flight tracking systems existed
2. **API confusion**: Two separate endpoints (`/api/v1/flights` and `/api/v1/live/flights`)
3. **Toggle confusion**: Flights were controlled by `assets` toggle instead of dedicated `flights` toggle
4. **Missing visibility**: No separate FLIGHTS button in the UI

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Flight Tracking
**Removed (unused):**
- ❌ `src/features/map/hooks/use-flight-tracking.ts`
- ❌ `src/app/api/v1/flights/route.ts`

**Kept (working):**
- ✅ `src/shared/hooks/use-live-flights.ts` (used by 3 components)
- ✅ `src/app/api/v1/live/flights/route.ts` (robust API with bbox support)

### 2. Updated IntelMap Component
**File:** `src/features/map/components/IntelMap.tsx`

- Switched from `useFlightTracking` to `useLiveFlights`
- Added flight data transformation to Asset format
- Added dedicated FLIGHTS toggle button (purple theme)
- Added debug logging for production troubleshooting

### 3. Updated Layer Visibility
**File:** `src/features/map/components/intel-map-layers.ts`

- Added `flights: boolean` to `LayerVisibility` type
- Changed flight layers to use `visibility.flights` instead of `visibility.assets`
- Now flights have independent toggle control

### 4. Button Configuration
Added new FLIGHTS button to the map controls:
```typescript
{ key: 'flights', label: 'FLIGHTS', active: { 
  bg: 'var(--purple-dim)', 
  border: 'var(--purple)', 
  color: 'var(--purple)' 
}}
```

## API Endpoints (Final State)

### ✅ `/api/v1/live/flights` (ACTIVE)
- **Used by:** LiveFlightsWidget, LiveFlightsPanel, LiveIntelFeed, IntelMap
- **Features:**
  - Bounding box filtering
  - ICAO24 specific aircraft lookup
  - 10-second cache with stale-while-revalidate
  - Proper error handling
  - OpenSky Network integration

### ❌ `/api/v1/flights` (REMOVED)
- Was only used by IntelMap
- Duplicate functionality
- Less flexible (no bbox support)

## Testing Checklist

### Local Development
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Open dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- [ ] Check browser console for flight logs:
  - `[IntelMap] Flights data updated`
  - `[Flight Tracking] Fetching flights`
- [ ] Toggle FLIGHTS button on/off
- [ ] Verify airplane icons appear on map

### Production (Netlify)
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Open browser DevTools → Console
- [ ] Check for flight API calls: `/api/v1/live/flights?bbox=24,32,42,63`
- [ ] Verify no 404 errors for `/api/v1/flights`
- [ ] Check flight count in console logs
- [ ] Toggle FLIGHTS button and verify visibility

## Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Netlify:

```bash
# Optional - increases OpenSky API rate limit
OPENSKY_USERNAME=your_username
OPENSKY_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Note:** The API works without credentials but has lower rate limits.

## Debugging Production Issues

If flights still don't show in production:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```
   [IntelMap] Flights data updated: { count: X, sample: {...}, visibility: true }
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Look for `/api/v1/live/flights?bbox=24,32,42,63`
   - Status should be 200
   - Response should have `{ ok: true, data: { flights: [...] } }`

3. **Check OpenSky API:**
   - May be rate-limited (429 error)
   - May be blocked by Netlify's IP
   - Check server logs for OpenSky errors

4. **Fallback Behavior:**
   - API should return empty array on error (not crash)
   - UI should handle empty flights gracefully

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Confusing)
```
IntelMap → useFlightTracking → /api/v1/flights → OpenSky
LiveFlightsWidget → useLiveFlights → /api/v1/live/flights → OpenSky
```

### After (Clean)
```
IntelMap → useLiveFlights → /api/v1/live/flights → OpenSky
LiveFlightsWidget → useLiveFlights → /api/v1/live/flights → OpenSky
LiveFlightsPanel → useLiveFlights → /api/v1/live/flights → OpenSky
LiveIntelFeed → useLiveFlights → /api/v1/live/flights → OpenSky
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Shared caching across components
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Easier to debug
- ✅ Less code to maintain

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** and verify flights appear
2. **Monitor console logs** for any errors
3. **Consider adding OpenSky credentials** if rate limiting occurs
4. **Remove debug logs** after confirming it works in production
5. **Add loading state** to FLIGHTS button when fetching
